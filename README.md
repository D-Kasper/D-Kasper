- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @D-Kasper
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web Development and Scripting
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Cyber security and Web 
- âš¡ Fun fact: The "404" error code, which indicates that a webpage cannot be found,
-             is humorously named after the room number 404 â€“ "Room Not Found" â€“ at CERN,
-             where the World Wide Web was invented. So when you encounter a 404 error,
-             just imagine yourself knocking on the door of room 404 and nobody answering!
